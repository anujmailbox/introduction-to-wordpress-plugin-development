# [Introduction to WordPress Plugin Development][published url]
## Instructor: [Tom McFarlin][instructor url]

In this course, we're going to take a look at everything that goes into building a WordPress plugin. We'll start from the ground up by setting up a web server, a database server and PHP. Next, we'll install WordPress and then we'll look into some of the sample plugins that are bundled with the software.

From there, we'll move on to examining the event-driven design pattern, how it factors into creating a WordPress plugin, and then we'll look at the differences between WordPress actions and WordPress filters.

Finally, we'll build our own plugin using various WordPress APIs, taking into account everything that's necessary to get the plugin fully functional for use in our installation of WordPress.
